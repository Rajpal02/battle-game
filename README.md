# Angular

`ng serve -o` It will run on localhost:4200

## Node Backend

Run `node server.js` for a dev server. It will run on localhost:3000, run it inside the battle-game folder.

## MongoDB

Run `mongod` after installing the mongodb community server. It will run on port 27017.

apis are working fine but not authenticated on frontend, for that genrerated jwt token can be stored in a cookie or can be used on frontend to authenticate the routes.

Also, for running mongodb server on macos, I used homebrew, to run the mongodb community server.
